^ In this session, we'll explore the design and affordances of the Askwith Kenner Global Languages & Cultures Room at Carnegie Mellon University. We will talk about the room, talk about some of the ways we're introducing immersive technologies and how we might support the adoption of VR technology in our programmes. *introduction - background in media production, taught as a graphics and media teacher, before moving into learning technologies at the University of Southampton, UK, leading the digital learning team. Moved to Pittsburgh in August last year to teach and curate projects in the global languages room.

^A room packed with technology, from smart screens to VR, teaching spaces, meeting room and lab. A room designed to connect student to cultures outside their own and better understand the real world through virtual worlds.  We want to bridge language learning in the instructed setting with language use in the real world, one that transforms students into not simply culturally competent speakers of the language but also engaged citizens and potentially agents of social change.

## Beyond the wow-factor
### How do we facilitate learning in immersive environments?

^still most people who enter space never experienced VR or tried a headset, many love it almost immediately, games background creates preconceptions,

^ Designers talk about "delight" a childlike joy in the experience, something new, exploratory, rewardingly simple. We want to students to recognise this feeling, sadly its not one that students regularly experience, but we're very interested in exploring it. We often put out big bits of paper and ask students to think about their pre-conceptions and then words that describe the experience itself. We're big fans of the Oculus welcome robot.

# What does a pedagogy for VR look and feel like? 

- Identifies **play** as a key component of learning
- Starts as a **personal** and becomes **shared** experience
- Enables students to **construct** meaning through VR activity

^ Student feedback has been around need to do more - for instance touch things, fly around, see **more**, feel **more**


![](NEALTT Presentation/IMG_6508.jpg)

^ The room alone cannot attempt to answer these questions but through multi-disciplinary research; exploring connections in human-computer interaction, language learning, architecture, games design and digital humanities, 
How can we truly harness new technology to provide engaging learning experiences?

## More questions..
- How to we ensure students have equal access to the technology?
- What can we learn in bridging the real world and virtual reality?
- Use immersive technologies to transform students into not simply culturally competent speakers, but potentially agents of social change? 

^ access means inclusivity, we need spaces in universities, but we also need vendors to help us, taking out an app as you would a book from the library, multi-user headsets. Headset manufacturers that take everyone into account, doesn't fit with certain headwear for instance. Glasses wearers (lens that can be ordered.
